# Hey! I'm Eric Xu

Frontend dev for the most part. (React, Typescript, CSS) Can do backend if forced to though (Kotlin, c++, Typescript). :P I've interned at Bloomberg like three times at this point, I've worked with Po Shen Loh on developing his competitive math game for a bit, and I'm currently spending all my free time on https://cmueats.com and https://scottylabs.org

Here are some quotes I like:
> Once we believe that art is self-expression, then the individual can be criticised not only for his skill or lack of skill, but simply for being what he is.

> Our brains haven't caught up to the fact that someone else's success doesn't diminish our chances of success. In the tribal world, resources were zero-sum. In the digital world, they're often not. But try telling that to your amygdala.


> Web development very often involves picking the least suboptimal approach to getting the job done until a better solution is devised.

> there's a trivial yet profound insight about software engineering, which is that it's mostly just detail orientation. there's almost no conceptual complexity, just many many details. if you can't write software it's mostly because you don't care enough about the details.
> This is contrast to fields like math and physics where there are load-bearing big insights to grok. but i'm still surprised when I look at a big software system how little of the code is conceptually deep. it's just "doing the obvious thing" a million times across the stack

> This moment is the youngest you’ll ever be. It’s a moment your future-selves will wish they could have back. Don’t waste it scrolling through posts you won’t even remember tomorrow.

> Your job is not to lock the doors and chisel at yourself like a marble statue in the darkness until you feel quantifiably worthy of the world outside. Your job, really, is to find people who love you for reasons you hardly understand, and to love them back, and to try as hard as you can to make it all easier for each other.
