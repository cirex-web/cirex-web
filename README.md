# Hey! I'm Eric Xu

Frontend dev for the most part. (React, Typescript, CSS) Can do backend if forced to though (Kotlin, c++, Typescript). :P 

Here are some quotes I like:

> If writing code for fun is like settling into a nice hot bath, writing code for work is like taking a shower, except that the temperature and water pressure fluctuate every few seconds and the water sometimes shuts off completely. I'm not sure if CS majors can relate to this analogy, however. - Me

> Web development very often involves picking the least suboptimal approach to getting the job done until a better solution is devised.

> there's a trivial yet profound insight about software engineering, which is that it's mostly just detail orientation. there's almost no conceptual complexity, just many many details. if you can't write software it's mostly because you don't care enough about the details.
> This is contrast to fields like math and physics where there are load-bearing big insights to grok. but i'm still surprised when I look at a big software system how little of the code is conceptually deep. it's just "doing the obvious thing" a million times across the stack

> This moment is the youngest you’ll ever be. It’s a moment your future-selves will wish they could have back. Don’t waste it scrolling through posts you won’t even remember tomorrow.

> Your job is not to lock the doors and chisel at yourself like a marble statue in the darkness until you feel quantifiably worthy of the world outside. Your job, really, is to find people who love you for reasons you hardly understand, and to love them back, and to try as hard as you can to make it all easier for each other.
