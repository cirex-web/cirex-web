Frontend dev for the most part. (React, Typescript, CSS) Can do backend if forced to though (Kotlin, c++, Typescript). :P

Your job, really, is to find people who love you for reasons you hardly understand, and to love them back, and to try as hard as you can to make it all easier for each other.

Call me naive and idealistic, but I wish to see the internet become a place to empower people to effect change in the real world rather than a place that justifies and propagates its own existence purely through engagement metrics - a phenonmenon commonly seen as an endless scroll through the mind-numbing, eye-catching content that trades your agency and self-thinking for shallow pleasure and shareholder profits.
